// This would typically include your API keys, but for security,
// these should be stored in environment variables on the server-side
// For demo purposes only:

export const API_ENDPOINTS = {
    PHISHSTATS: 'https://phishstats.info/api',
    // Add other API endpoints here
  };
  
  // Note: In a real application, API keys should not be exposed in client-side code
  // For a production app, you would need a backend service to proxy these requests
